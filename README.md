# Projects - Connor Galvin

This page contains the code and analysis of several projects that I have worked on for school and in my own time. 


## Thesis - Designing a stability metric for assessing the robustness of anomaly rankings

Master's thesis completed over the 2019-2020 academic year at KU Leuven. An abridged version has been accepted as a submission to the ECML PKDD conference to be held in September 2020.

## Computer Vision- Deep learning models

Final Project for course "Computer Vision" Spring 2020 at KU Leuven. In this project I experiment with deep learning for image classification in Tensorflow and Keras. Additionally I demonstrate how one could use an encoder-decoder network to "fool" a deep learning classifier.

## Computer Vision- Demonstration Video

Demonstration of computer vision techniques including object detection and tracking. Implemented with Python OpenCV.

## Traffic Tracking using Computer Vision

This is my project for Applied Mathematics Capstone, completed Spring 2019 at Northeastern University. My partner and I experimented with object detection and tracking to count the number of cars passing in either direction of a two way road.  

The project was implemented using Pythion's OpenCV library. By the end of the project we were succesfully able to implement a traffic counting program that works well in ideal lighting conditions.

## Sentiment Analysis on Amazon reviews

This is my final project for EECE 5644, Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, which I completed Spring 2018 at Northeastern University. I built a sentiment analysis model that predicts the star value of a product review on Amazon given the text of the review. The dataset, which I found on Kaggle, contains 100,000 written product reviews and their star ratings. 

My model experiments with different machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear SVC, and SGD). I also tested different methods for feature extraction and vectorization of the text of each review.
