# Machine Learning Portfolio - Connor Galvin

This portfolio contains the code, datasets, and analysis of several projects that I have worked on for school and in my own free time.

## Sentiment Analysis on Amazon reviews

This is my final project for EECE 5644, Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, which I completed Spring 2018 at Northeastern University. I built a sentiment analysis model that predicts the star value of a product review on Amazon given the text of the review. The dataset, originally found on Kaggle, can be downloaded here. 

My model experiments with different machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear SVC, and SGD). I also test out different methods for feature extraction, including the filtering of stopwords, how the words in a review are vectorized (Count and TF-IDF), and how many words the model can reads in at a time (unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams).
