# Works & Projects - Connor Galvin

This page contains the code, datasets, and analysis of several projects that I have worked on for school and in my own free time.

## Sentiment Analysis on Amazon reviews

This is my final project for EECE 5644, Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, which I completed Spring 2018 at Northeastern University. I built a sentiment analysis model that predicts the star value of a product review on Amazon given the text of the review. The dataset, which I found on Kaggle, contains 100,000 written product reviews and their star ratings. 

My model experiments with different machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Linear SVC, and SGD). I also tested different methods for feature extraction and vectorization of the text of each review.

## Discrinant function classification for multivariate normal distributions

This code plots points from two multivariate (in this case n=2) normal distributions in the same feature space. Then, I use a discriminant equation to assign each point to one of two classes, and draw the decision boundary between the classes.

## Manual implementation of K-means clustering 

This code manually implements the steps that are used in K-means clustering. Instead of using the built in sklearn function for k-means, I have coded the mathematical steps behind the  algorithm. I tested the algorithm on the Iris dataset.
